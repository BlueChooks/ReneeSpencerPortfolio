                        <h1>The Give App</h1>
                        <p>
                            Give is designed to encourage regular giving to charity. The user selects any number  
                            from a list of partnered charities, links their bank account to Give's system, and whenever 
                            they spend money, their payment is rounded up to the nearest dollar and the difference is distributed 
                            amongst their chosen pool of charities.<br />
                            We wanted to design an easy, unobtrusive way to donate regularly. Give breaks down the barriers of 
                            commitment and financial strain, with each donation so small as to be unnoticeable, but adding up over time 
                            into a tangible positive impact.<br />
                            This project was a group effort. I was responsible for the wireframes, some of the 
                            higher-fidelity pages, and the interactivity of the prototype.
